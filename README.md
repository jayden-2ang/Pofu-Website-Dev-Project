I will be making 4.5 pages (the Client Photography page will be a link to another application), which will be a: Home Page,
Photobooth Page, Event Photography Page, Client Gallery Page, and a Contact/Booking Page. 

The purpose of this project is to see if I can improve an already existing website which uses website builders, and improve
the overall user interface, user features, as well as the appearance.
